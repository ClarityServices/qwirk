If you want to use the default InMem adapter, you don't need to do anything
to run the examples.  If you want to run the JMS adapter, copy the jms.yml.template
file to jms.yml and modify it as needed (or set the environment variable
ACTIVEMQ_HOME to the correct value).  Refer to the jruby-jms project for
more options for the jms.yml file.
